Challenge Four - Create timed quiz on Javascript Fundaments

Overview of project process:<p>
  First, I split the sample gif into individual frames. I will use the information contain on these frames to create 
  the questions for the quiz. Next, I plan to draft the html content and css style for each question. Once the content has been generated, I will refer back to the Web API materials to add the following interactivity to the page:<p>
    event listener - when clicked, the quiz begins<p>
    timer intervals - create countdown and configure code to reduce time (by 10/15 secs) when an answer is incorrect
      additionally, i would like to be creative here and add a "consequence" - similar to "colorsplosion" image that 
      "goes off" when the timer interval reaches zero<p>
    local storage - save user info and store to browser storage

After beginning the project and attempting to build the page from scratch, I am going to use a YT tutorial put together by James Q Quick for guidance. 
I found myself struggling with styling the landing page and questions so I am using this tutorial to give me the basis for why and how styling and 
used and I will adjust items to meet my own design guidelines after completing the buildout of the framework based on the tutorial.
