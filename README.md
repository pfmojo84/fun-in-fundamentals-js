Challenge Four - Create timed quiz on Javascript Fundaments

Overview of project process:
  First, I split the sample gif into individual frames. I will use the information contain on these frames to create 
  the questions for the quiz. Next, I plan to draft the html content and css style for each question. Once the content has been generated, I will refer back to the Web API materials to add the following interactivity to the page:
    event listener - when clicked, the quiz begins
    timer intervals - create countdown and configure code to reduce time (by 10/15 secs) when an answer is incorrect
      additionally, i would like to be creative here and add a "consequence" - similar to "colorsplosion" image that 
      "goes off" when the timer interval reaches zero
    local storage - save user info and store to browser storage
