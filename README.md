Challenge Four - Create timed quiz on Javascript Fundaments

Overview of project process:<p>
  First, I split the sample gif into individual frames. I will use the information contain on these frames to create 
  the questions for the quiz. Next, I plan to draft the html content and css style for each question. Once the content has been generated, I will refer back to the Web API materials to add the following interactivity to the page:<p>
    event listener - when clicked, the quiz begins<p>
    timer intervals - create countdown and configure code to reduce time (by 10/15 secs) when an answer is incorrect<p>
    local storage - save user info and store to browser storage

After beginning the project and attempting to build the page from scratch, I am going to use a YT tutorial put together by James Q Quick for guidance. 
I found myself struggling with styling the landing page and questions so I am using this tutorial to give me the basis for functionality and design. 
I added the timer functions and set the timer to decrease if a user gets a question incorrect. I also set the high scores to include the top five highest scores and splice after the top scores are set.<p> 
This was a challenging but fun assignment and I'm grateful for the help of the BCS teaching assistants and my professor for helping me debug issues I had with the timer, high scores, and local storage. On to Challenge #5!
